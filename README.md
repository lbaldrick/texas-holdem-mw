Texas holdem middleware project.

Project I have used to improve my Java 8 skills as well as try out implementing state machine pattern for poker game. 

This application is the middleware for my https://github.com/lbaldrick/poker-game react frontend which I am using to improve my react skills

This application speaks to another middleware service https://github.com/lbaldrick/clients which interacts with mongodb and is used to hold 
client data
